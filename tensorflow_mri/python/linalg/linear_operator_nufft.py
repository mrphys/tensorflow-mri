class LinearOperatorNUFFT(linear_operator_nd.LinearOperatorND):
  r"""Linear operator acting like a [batch] nonuniform Fourier matrix.

  Performs an N-dimensional discrete Fourier transform via the nonuniform fast
  Fourier transform (NUFFT) algorithm. Let $A$ represent this linear operator,
  then:

  - The forward operator $A$ evaluates the forward, type-2 NUFFT (signal domain
    to frequency domain, uniform to nonuniform).
  - The adjoint operator $A^H$ evaluates the backward, type-1 NUFFT
    (frequency domain to signal domain, nonuniform to uniform).

  The dimensionality of the grid $N_0 \times ... \times N_d$ is determined by
  `domain_shape`. The $M$ non-uniform sampling locations in the frequency
  domain are defined by `points`.

  ```{rubric} Inverse NUFFT
  ```
  ```{note}
  The NUFFT operator is not generally invertible, so calling `inverse` or
  `solve` (or the related `solvevec` and `solvevec_nd`) will raise an error.
  ```

  However, you can solve $Ax = b$ in the least-squares sense.

  One approach is to use this operator's `lstsq` method (or one of the related
  methods `lstsqvec` and `lstsqvec_nd`).

  ```{attention}
  If you intend to use `lstsq`, `lstsqvec`, or `lstsqvec_nd`, you should
  consider providing `crosstalk_inverse` (see below). If you do not provide
  this argument, the solution will be computed using a potentially very slow
  algorithm which requires conversion to a dense matrix.
  ```

  Alternatively, you could use `tfmri.linalg.lsqr` or
  `tfmri.linalg.conjugate_gradient` to solve the least-squares problem
  iteratively.

  ```{rubric} Fourier crosstalk matrix
  ```
  The Fourier crosstalk matrix is the matrix $D = A A^H$. The solution to the
  least-squares problem can be written in terms of $D$ as $x = A^H D^{-1} y$.

  Hence, if $D{-1}$ is known, the least-squares problem can be solved without
  performing an explicit inversion. The argument `crosstalk_inverse` allows
  you to provide $D{-1}$.

  The matrix $D$ (and hence, $D{-1}$) is dependent on the sampling locations
  `points`. For arbitrary sampling patterns, this matrix is full and requires
  $O(M^2)$ storage, with a runtime complexity of $O(M^3)$ for matrix-matrix
  multiplication (where $M$ is the number of non-uniform samples). This is
  clearly impractical for large $M$. Furthermore, in this case one might as
  well just store and apply $A{-1}$ directly.

  A more interesting use of `crosstalk_inverse` is to provide an approximation
  to $D{-1}$ with a more favorable structure. A common choice is to use a
  diagonal matrix, which requires only $O(M)$ storage and whose matrix-matrix
  product runs in $O(M^2)$ time. In MRI, this is often referred to as
  **sampling density compensation**.

  ```{tip}
  If `weights` are your density compensation weights, use
  `crosstalk_inverse=tfmri.linalg.LinearOperatorDiag(weights)`.
  ```

  ```{rubric} TLDR: how do I invert the NUFFT?
  ```
  Essentially, you have two options:

  1. **Direct approximation** (in MRI, sometimes called the **conjugate phase**
     method): If the inverse of the Fourier crosstalk matrix $D^{-1}$ has
     favorable structure (i.e., it does not have large storage requirements and
     it can be applied quickly), or you can use an approximation which does,
     specify `crosstalk_inverse` and then use `lstsq` (or one of the related
     methods `lstsqvec` and `lstsqvec_nd`). Under these conditions, this method
     is probably faster, but might compromise accuracy depending on your choice
     of $D^{-1}$.
  2. **Minimum-norm least-squares solution**: If you do not know `D{-1}`, or if
     accuracy is paramount, use `tfmri.linalg.lsqr` or
     `tfmri.linalg.conjugate_gradient` to solve the least-squares problem
     iteratively. This method might be slower due to its iterative nature.
  ```

  ```{seealso}
  `tfmri.linalg.LinearOperatorFFT` for uniformly sampled Fourier transforms.
  ```

  Args:
    domain_shape: A 1D integer `tf.Tensor`. The domain shape of this
      operator. This is usually the shape of the image but may include
      additional dimensions. Must have length 1, 2 or 3.
    points: A `tf.Tensor` of type `float32` or `float64`. Contains the
      non-uniform sampling locations in the frequency domain. Must have
      shape `[..., M, N]`, where `N` is the number of dimensions (rank,
      must be 1, 2 or 3), `M` is the number of samples and `...` is the
      batch shape, which can have any number of dimensions. Must be in the
      range `[-pi, pi]`.
      ```{tip}
      In MRI, this is the *k*-space trajectory.
      ```
    crosstalk_inverse: A `tf.Tensor` or `tf.linalg.LinearOperator` of shape
      `[..., M, M]` representing the inverse of the Fourier crosstalk
      matrix [2]. This matrix is used to simplify the computation of the
      pseudo-inverse $A^{+}$ and/or to solve the least-squares problem defined
      by this operator. Ideally this matrix should be equal to $(A A^H)^{-1}$,
      where $A$ is this operator, but you can also provide an approximation
      with a more favorable structure depending on your purposes. Defaults to
      `None`.
      ```{attention}
      If you intend to use `lstsq`, `lstsqvec`, or `lstsqvec_nd`, you are
      strongly encouraged to provide `crosstalk_inverse`. If you do not,
      these methods will use a potentially very slow algorithm which requires
      conversion to a dense matrix.
      ```
      ```{warning}
      This operator will not check `crosstalk_inverse` for correctness. It is
      your responsibility to ensure that it is reasonable your purposes.
      ```
      ```{tip}
      In MRI, you can use `crosstalk_inverse` for density compensation by
      specifying a diagonal operator whose diagonal elements are the density
      compensation weights.
      ```
      ```{tip}
      If you do not need to invert this operator, you can safely ignore this
      argument.
      ```
    is_non_singular: A boolean, or `None`. Whether this operator is expected
      to be non-singular. Defaults to `None`.
    is_self_adjoint: A boolean, or `None`. Whether this operator is expected
      to be equal to its Hermitian transpose. If `dtype` is real, this is
      equivalent to being symmetric. Defaults to `False`.
    is_positive_definite: A boolean, or `None`. Whether this operators is
      expected to be positive definite, meaning the quadratic form $x^H A x$
      has positive real part for all nonzero $x$. Note that we do not require
      the operator to be self-adjoint to be positive-definite. See:
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive-definite_matrix#Extension_for_non-symmetric_matrices.
      Defaults to `None`.
    is_square: A boolean, or `None`. Expect that this operator acts like a
      square matrix (or a batch of square matrices). Defaults to `False`.
    name: An optional `str`. The name of this operator.

  Example:
    >>> # Create some data.
    >>> image_shape = (128, 128)
    >>> image = tfmri.image.phantom(shape=image_shape, dtype=tf.complex64)
    >>> trajectory = tfmri.sampling.radial_trajectory(
    ...     base_resolution=128, views=129, flatten_encoding_dims=True)
    >>> density = tfmri.sampling.radial_density(
    ...     base_resolution=128, views=129, flatten_encoding_dims=True)
    >>> # Create a NUFFT operator.
    >>> linop = tfmri.linalg.LinearOperatorNUFFT(
    ...     image_shape, trajectory=trajectory)
    >>> # Create non-uniform k-space.
    >>> kspace = tfmri.signal.nufft(image, trajectory)
