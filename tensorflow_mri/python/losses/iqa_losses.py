  Args:
    max_val: The dynamic range of the images (i.e., the difference between
      the maximum and the minimum allowed values). Defaults to 1 for floating
      point input images and `MAX` for integer input images, where `MAX` is the
      largest positive representable number for the data type.
    filter_size: The size of the Gaussian filter. Defaults to 11.
    filter_sigma: The standard deviation of the Gaussian filter. Defaults to
      1.5.
    k1: Factor used to calculate the regularization constant for the luminance
      term, as `C1 = (k1 * max_val) ** 2`. Defaults to 0.01.
    k2: Factor used to calculate the regularization constant for the contrast
      term, as `C2 = (k2 * max_val) ** 2`. Defaults to 0.03.
    rank: An `int`. The number of spatial dimensions. Must be 2 or 3. Defaults
      to `tf.rank(y_true) - 2`. In other words, if rank is not explicitly set,
      `y_true` and `y_pred` should have shape `[batch, height, width, channels]`
      if processing 2D images or `[batch, depth, height, width, channels]` if
      processing 3D images.
    reduction: Type of `tf.keras.losses.Reduction` to apply to loss. Default
      value is `AUTO`.
    name: String name of the loss instance.
