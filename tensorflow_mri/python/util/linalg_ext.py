"""Additional linear algebra operators."""

import tensorflow as tf

from tensorflow_mri.python.util import check_util


class LinearOperatorAddition(tf.linalg.LinearOperator):  # pylint: disable=abstract-method
  """Adds one or more `LinearOperators`.

  This operator adds one or more linear operators `op1 + op2 + ... + opJ`,
  building a new `LinearOperator` with action defined by:

  ```
  op_addition(x) := op1(x) + op2(x) + op3(x)
  ```

  If `opj` acts like [batch] matrix `Aj`, then `op_addition` acts like the
  [batch] matrix formed with the addition `A1 + A2 + ... + AJ`.

  If each `opj` has shape `batch_shape_j + [M, N]`, then the addition operator
  has shape equal to `broadcast_batch_shape + [M, N]`, where
  `broadcast_batch_shape` is the mutual broadcast of `batch_shape_j`,
  `j = 1, ..., J`, assuming the intermediate batch shapes broadcast.

  ```python
  # Create a 2 x 2 linear operator composed of two 2 x 2 operators.
  operator_1 = LinearOperatorFullMatrix([[1., 2.], [3., 4.]])
  operator_2 = LinearOperatorFullMatrix([[1., 0.], [0., 1.]])
  operator = LinearOperatorAddition([operator_1, operator_2])

  operator.to_dense()
  ==> [[2., 2.]
       [3., 5.]]

  operator.shape
  ==> [2, 2]
  ```

  #### Performance

  The performance of `LinearOperatorAddition` on any operation is equal to
  the sum of the individual operators' operations.


  #### Matrix property hints

  This `LinearOperator` is initialized with boolean flags of the form `is_X`,
  for `X = non_singular, self_adjoint, positive_definite, square`.
  These have the following meaning:

  * If `is_X == True`, callers should expect the operator to have the
    property `X`.  This is a promise that should be fulfilled, but is *not* a
    runtime assert.  For example, finite floating point precision may result
    in these promises being violated.
  * If `is_X == False`, callers should expect the operator to not have `X`.
  * If `is_X == None` (the default), callers should have no expectation either
    way.

  Args:
    operators: Iterable of `LinearOperator` objects, each with
      the same shape and dtype.
    is_non_singular: Expect that this operator is non-singular.
    is_self_adjoint: Expect that this operator is equal to its hermitian
      transpose.
    is_positive_definite: Expect that this operator is positive definite,
      meaning the quadratic form `x^H A x` has positive real part for all
      nonzero `x`.  Note that we do not require the operator to be
      self-adjoint to be positive-definite.  See:
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive-definite_matrix#Extension_for_non-symmetric_matrices
    is_square:  Expect that this operator acts like square [batch] matrices.
    name: A name for this `LinearOperator`.  Default is the individual
      operators names joined with `_p_`.

  Raises:
    TypeError: If all operators do not have the same `dtype`.
    ValueError: If `operators` is empty.
