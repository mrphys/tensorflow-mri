  """Write an animated GIF image summary.

  Args:
    name: A name for this summary. The summary tag used for TensorBoard will
      be this name prefixed by any active name scopes.
    data: A tensor representing pixel data with shape [k, t, h, w, c], where
      k is the number of images, t is the number of frames, h and w are
      the height and width of the images, and c is the number of channels,
      which should be 1 or 3 (grayscale, RGB). Any of the dimensions may
      be statically unknown (i.e., None). Floating point data will be
      clipped to the range [0, 1]. Other data types will be clipped into
      an allowed range for safe casting to uint8, using
      `tf.image.convert_image_dtype`.
    step: Monotonic step value for this summary. If omitted, this defaults
      to `tf.summary.experimental.get_step()`, which must not be None.
    max_outputs: Maximum number of animated images to be emitted at each
      step. When more than `max_outputs` images are provided, the first
      `max_outputs` images will be used and the rest silently discarded.
    loop_count: Number of times the animation should be looped. Set to 0 for
      endless looping.
    description: A string containing a description for this summary.

  Returns:
    True if successful, or False if no summary was emitted because no
    default summary writer was available.
