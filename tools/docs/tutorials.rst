TensorFlow MRI tutorials
========================

All TensorFlow MRI tutorials are written as Jupyter notebooks.

In addition to viewing them on this website, you can run them directly in
Google Colab, a hosted notebook environment with no setup and free access to
GPUs. Click on the **Run in Colab** button to begin.

Alternatively, you can also download the notebooks to run on your machine.
