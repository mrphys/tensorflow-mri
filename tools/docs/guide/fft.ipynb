    "TensorFlow MRI uses the built-in FFT ops in core TensorFlow. These are [`tf.signal.fft`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/signal/fft), [`tf.signal.fft2d`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/signal/fft2d) and [`tf.signal.fft3d`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/signal/fft3d).\n",

    "## Custom FFT kernels for CPU\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, TensorFlow's FFT ops are [known to be slow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/6541) on CPU. As a result, the FFT can become a significant bottleneck on MRI processing pipelines, especially on iterative reconstructions where the FFT is called repeatedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this issue, TensorFlow MRI provides a set of custom FFT kernels based on the FFTW library. These offer a significant boost in performance compared to the kernels in core TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The custom FFT kernels are automatically registered to the TensorFlow framework when importing TensorFlow MRI. If you have imported TensorFlow MRI, then the standard FFT ops will use the optimized kernels automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{tip}\n",
    "You only need to `import tensorflow_mri` in order to use the custom FFT kernels. You can then access them as usual through `tf.signal.fft`, `tf.signal.fft2d` and `tf.signal.fft3d`.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "The only caveat is that the [FFTW license](https://www.fftw.org/doc/License-and-Copyright.html) is more restrictive than the [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) used by TensorFlow MRI. In particular, GNU GPL requires you to distribute any derivative software under equivalent terms.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{warning}\n",
    "If you intend to use custom FFT kernels for commercial purposes, you will need to purchase a commercial FFTW license.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Disable the use of custom FFT kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "You can control whether custom FFT kernels are used via the `TFMRI_USE_CUSTOM_FFT` environment variable. When set to false, TensorFlow MRI will not register its custom FFT kernels, falling back to the standard FFT kernels in core TensorFlow. If the variable is unset, its value defaults to true.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{tip}\n",
    "Set `TFMRI_USE_CUSTOM_FFT=0` to disable the custom FFT kernels. This must be done **before** importing TensorFlow MRI. Setting or changing the value of `TFMRI_USE_CUSTOM_FFT` after importing the package will have no effect.\n",
