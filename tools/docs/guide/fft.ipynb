    "# Fast Fourier transform (FFT)\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow MRI uses the built-in FFT ops in core TensorFlow. These are [`tf.signal.fft`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/signal/fft), [`tf.signal.fft2d`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/signal/fft2d) and [`tf.signal.fft3d`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/signal/fft3d).\n",
    "\n",
    "## N-dimensional FFT\n",
    "\n",
    "For convenience, TensorFlow MRI also provides [`tfmri.signal.fft`](https://mrphys.github.io/tensorflow-mri/api_docs/tfmri/signal/fft/), which can be used for N-dimensional FFT calculations and provides convenient access to commonly used functionality such as padding/cropping, normalization and shifting of the zero-frequency component within the same function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Custom FFT kernels for CPU\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, TensorFlow's FFT ops are [known to be slow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/6541) on CPU. As a result, the FFT can become a significant bottleneck on MRI processing pipelines, especially on iterative reconstructions where the FFT is called repeatedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this issue, TensorFlow MRI provides a set of custom FFT kernels based on the FFTW library. These offer a significant boost in performance compared to the kernels in core TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The custom FFT kernels are automatically registered to the TensorFlow framework when importing TensorFlow MRI. If you have imported TensorFlow MRI, then the standard FFT ops will use the optimized kernels automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "You only need to `import tensorflow_mri` in order to use the custom FFT kernels. You can then access them as usual through `tf.signal.fft`, `tf.signal.fft2d` and `tf.signal.fft3d`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The only caveat is that the [FFTW license](https://www.fftw.org/doc/License-and-Copyright.html) is more restrictive than the [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) used by TensorFlow MRI. In particular, GNU GPL requires you to distribute any derivative software under equivalent terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "If you intend to use custom FFT kernels for commercial purposes, you will need to purchase a commercial FFTW license.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disable the use of custom FFT kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "You can control whether custom FFT kernels are used via the `TFMRI_USE_CUSTOM_FFT` environment variable. When set to false, TensorFlow MRI will not register its custom FFT kernels, falling back to the standard FFT kernels in core TensorFlow. If the variable is unset, its value defaults to true.\n",

    "FFTW allows you to control the rigor of the planning process. The more rigorously a plan is created, the more efficient the actual FFT execution is likely to be, at the expense of a longer planning time. TensorFlow MRI lets you control the FFTW planning rigor through the `TFMRI_FFTW_PLANNING_RIGOR` environment variable. Valid values for this variable are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\"estimate\"` specifies that, instead of actual measurements of different algorithms, a simple heuristic is used to pick a (probably sub-optimal) plan quickly.\n",
    "- `\"measure\"` tells FFTW to find an optimized plan by actually computing several FFTs and measuring their execution time. Depending on your machine, this can take some time (often a few seconds). This is the default planning option.\n",
    "- `\"patient\"` is like `\"measure\"`, but considers a wider range of algorithms and often produces a “more optimal” plan (especially for large transforms), but at the expense of several times longer planning time (especially for large transforms).\n",
    "- `\"exhaustive\"` is like `\"patient\"`, but considers an even wider range of algorithms, including many that we think are unlikely to be fast, to produce the most optimal plan but with a substantially increased planning time.\n",
    "\n",

    "Set the environment variable `TFMRI_FFTW_PLANNING_RIGOR` to control the planning rigor.\n",

    "```{note}\n",
    "FFTW accumulates \"wisdom\" each time the planner is called, and this wisdom is persisted across invocations of the FFT kernels (during the same process). Therefore, more rigorous planning options will result in long planning times during the first FFT invocation, but may result in faster execution during subsequent invocations. When performing a large amount of similar FFT invocations (e.g., while training a model or performing iterative reconstructions), you are more likely to benefit from more rigorous planning.\n",
