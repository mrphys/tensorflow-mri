Release 0.4.0
=============

Major Features and Improvements
-------------------------------

* Added coil compression functions ``tfmr.compress_coils`` and
  ``tfmr.coil_compression_matrix``. Currently they implement the SVD coil
  compression method, but the API is prepared to support other methods which
  will be added in the future.
